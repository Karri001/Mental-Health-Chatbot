# Mental-Health-Chatbot

## Overview
The Mental Health Chatbot is an interactive web-based platform designed to provide users with a safe and supportive environment to discuss their thoughts and emotions. Powered by Ollama as the core conversational engine, the chatbot engages users in empathetic, human-like conversations to promote mental wellness and emotional support.

## Repository
This project is hosted on GitHub: [Mental Health Chatbot Repository](https://github.com/Karri001/Mental-Health-Chatbot)

## Features
- **Conversational AI (Ollama Integration)**: The chatbot uses Ollama’s local large language model as its “brain” to understand and respond naturally to user inputs.
- **Chat History**: Each user’s previous conversations are securely stored and retrievable, allowing continuity and personalization in future sessions.
- **User Authentication**:
  - Signup: Create a new account with secure credentials.
  - Login: Access personalized chat experiences.
  - Forgot Password: Reset password securely using email verification or token-based recovery.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with React, the interface is intuitive, user-friendly, and optimized for both desktop and mobile use.
- **Backend & Database**:
  - Python (Flask/FastAPI): Handles communication with Ollama, authentication, and chat data management.
  - MongoDB: Stores user data, chat histories, and authentication details.

## How It Works
1. **User Authentication**: 
   - Users sign up or log in using their email and password.
   - The system verifies credentials (stored securely in MongoDB) and creates a session using tokens.
2. **Chat Interface**: 
   - Once logged in, users access the chat screen built with React.
   - They can send messages to the chatbot through a simple, responsive UI.
3. **Backend Processing**: 
   - Each message is sent from the frontend to the Python backend (Flask/FastAPI).
   - The backend forwards the user’s input to Ollama, which serves as the AI “brain.”
4. **Ollama Response Generation**: 
   - Ollama processes the input using its local large language model.
   - It generates a natural, empathetic reply suitable for mental health support conversations.
5. **Chat History Management**: 
   - The backend stores both user messages and bot replies in MongoDB.
   - When users return, the chatbot loads their previous chat history for context and continuity.
6. **Optional Password Recovery**: 
   - If a user forgets their password, a secure token or email-based reset process is triggered.

## Future Enhancements
- Allow users to chat in different languages by integrating multilingual models or translation APIs.
- Build a cross-platform mobile app using React Native or Flutter for on-the-go mental health support.
- Add speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities so users can talk and listen instead of typing.
- Improve the UI with theme switching, larger fonts, and accessibility options for better user experience.
- Implement end-to-end encryption and anonymization to enhance user trust and data security.
